# Description:
#   creates an ingestor/links dir in the bundle and symlinks all .out* files in it for ease of location
#   - could be used by other scripts to prevent having to know exact dirs to look in, perhaps

# include generic functions file
#source /root/Collector/Ingestor/ingestion-scripts/functions.sh
source /home/rmesta/ws/src/Ingestor/Ingestor/ingestion-scripts/functions.sh

# name of this script - could be filename, or something unique people will recognize
SCRIPT_NAME="A1-create-symlinks.sh"

# put your actual code within this function, be sure to exit 0 if successful and
# exit 1 if not
main () {
    BUNDLE_DIR=$1 # use BUNDLE_DIR inside here, don't use $1, just for sanity

    mkdir -p ${BUNDLE_DIR}/ingestor/links/

    cd ${BUNDLE_DIR}/ingestor/links

    # all .out files is easy:
    for OUT_FILE in `ls -1 -R ../../*/*.out*`; do
        ln -s ${OUT_FILE}
    done

    # /var/adm/messages is a commonly desired one, find it (depending on version of Collector could be in 2 places)
    MDIR="os"
    if [ -f ../../kernel/messages ]; then
        MDIR="kernel"
    fi

    for FILE in `ls -1 ../../${MDIR}/messages*`; do
        ln -s $FILE
    done
}

# this runs first, and does sanity checking before invoking main() function

# check for necessary directory argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "${SCRIPT_NAME} failed, no directory specified."
    exit 1
