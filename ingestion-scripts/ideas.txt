Ideas that have not been implemented yet go in this file. Remove them as you implement them. 
Could also assign an idea to yourself if you plan on working on it in near future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check that primarycache is not off on any dataset, in general.
Check that secondary cache is not off on any dataset when the pool has L2ARC.
Make sure dump device is sized adequately.
Warn on sync=disabled on any dataset.
Warn on sync=standard or writeback cache off on zvols.
Warn on atime=on on datasets. (worth it?)
Implement functionality similar to volume-check to warn on non-redundant vdevs,
      dissimilar vdev layouts, unequal disk sizes and unequal models
Implement extraction of fhardware and firmware versions to allow for quick identification of 
      possible root causes and future comparision against HSL
Implement analytics/correlate FMA data with disk issues ( and other hardware issues )
Warn on excessive space usage of snapshots (threshold TBD)
Warn on checksum=off anywhere
Warn on compression=!off/zle if compressratio < 1.02
Warn on mountpoint of child datasets not matching mountpoint of parent
Warn on dedup=on and dedup ratio < 2x, make note of dedup=on.
Warn on low zfs used/avail ratio on the root of the pool
Warn on zfs_no_write_throttle=1 or non-zero zfs_write_limit_override
Warn on zfs_nocacheflush
Warn on any pools not ONLINE
Detect and warn on SUP-664
Warn on 3TB and larger drives in 2-way mirrors or raidz1
Warn on stale NMS locks (older than 1 day?)
Warn on obviously unconfigured mailer (no smtp_server, no smtp_addresses)
Warn on any runners that are in maintenance
Check for incorrect lm_auth version for the appliance version (correct levels TBD)
Check for LINK UP FC events in messages that are not on boot - might indicate fabric issue
Check for disks where not all paths are ONLINE or STANDBY
Check for disk errors in various places
Check scsi_vhci.conf to make sure it has nothing stupid in it.
Check if all non-syspool disks are under mpxio
Warn about non-standard entries in sd.conf
Warn about SATA drives behind expanders
Warn if any default FMA modules are not active
Check for error counter outliers in HBA stats (sasinfo) - need to find good examples
Warn if excessive daisy-chaining is detected in sasinfo expander -t (Tier 3 might already be shady, but depends on other conditions)
Warn if any driver instances of the same name have non-matching amount of interrupts assigned to them
Warn if any drivers share interrupts
Warn if kmem_flags != 0 (performance impact)
Warn if non-standard tuneables are present in /etc/system (need to maintain a list of commonly used ones and thresholds)
Warn if /etc/system doesn't match ::system | mdb -k - means something was changed since last reboot
Warn if recent dumps (<1 month old) are present in /var/crash/myhost
Warn on out-of-date version of collector

Continue updating this list


Warn on drives that aren't under mpxio that should be. (to prevent mismatched id's)
Warn when DataOn plugin is installed - it causes latency spikes roughly every 10 minutes because it runs "zpool import -D" and "zpool import -Fn" for no good reason, and servermain.py has a memory leak in it.
